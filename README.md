## üìò Project Overview  

This project analyzes pizza sales data using **SQL** and **Excel** to uncover insights on revenue, top-selling pizzas, and customer trends.  
It features an interactive dashboard that highlights **sales performance**, **peak order times**, and **best/worst-selling products**, helping businesses make **data-driven decisions** for improved efficiency and growth.  

## üß© Problem Statement  

We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance.  
Specifically, we aim to calculate the following metrics (KPIs):  

### üìä KPI Requirements  

1. **Total Revenue:**  
   The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.  

2. **Average Order Value:**  
   The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.  

3. **Total Pizzas Sold:**  
   The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.  

4. **Total Orders:**  
   The total number of orders placed.  

5. **Average Pizzas Per Order:**  
   The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.  

## üìä Charts Requirement  

We aim to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends.  
The following charts were created to fulfill these requirements:  

1. **Daily Trend for Total Orders:**  
   A bar chart displaying the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period.  
   This helps identify patterns or fluctuations in daily order volumes.  

2. **Hourly Trend for Total Orders:**  
   A line chart illustrating the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day.  
   This reveals peak hours or periods of high order activity.  

3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:**  
   A pie chart showing the distribution of sales across different pizza categories.  
   This provides insights into the popularity of pizza categories and their contribution to total sales.  

4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:**  
   A pie chart representing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes.  
   This helps understand customer preferences for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.  

5. **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:**  
   A funnel chart presenting the total number of pizzas sold for each category.  
   This allows comparison of sales performance across different pizza categories.  

6. **Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:**  
   A bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on total pizzas sold.  
   This identifies the most popular pizza options.  

7. **Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:**  
   A bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on total pizzas sold.  
   This helps identify underperforming or less popular pizza options.
